          <p>Shor&rsquo;s algorithm is probably the most well known quantum algorithm. But it turns out I didn&rsquo;t understand it as well as I thought.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat giving up on this problem. I got a working version, but I&rsquo;m not happy with it.</p>
<p>Spoiler, I thought the hard part of Shor&rsquo;s algorithm would be the Quantum Fourier Transform. It turns out the hard problem is multiplying two numbers!</p>
<p>Anyways, this post will give a super introductory look into RSA, Shor&rsquo;s algorithm, and some rants about multiplication.</p>
<h2 id="shors">Shor&rsquo;s</h2>
<p>This was the first Quantum Algorithm I heard about (my background is computer security). Using Shor&rsquo;s algorithm you can factor large numbers. Which at the surface seems pretty unexciting, but then we remember that a lot of the world&rsquo;s security is based on the fact that it&rsquo;s hard to factor numbers. Factoring numbers is of huge importance.</p>
<h3 id="rsa">RSA</h3>
<p>RSA (and other asymmetric algorithms) are pretty cool. It&rsquo;s a way to securely communicate with someone you&rsquo;ve never met before, while others are listening. To prove to yourself how cool it is, try this thought experiment:</p>
<p>Lets say you found yourself in jail, and you knew a terrible secret, and you wanted to notify a news agency of the terrible secret. But the guards are reading your letters. You&rsquo;ve never met the news agency before. Can you hide a message in letters that only the news agency would find?</p>
<p>Or a more real example, imagine you&rsquo;re sitting at home, ordering something online from amazon.com, you need to give amazon.com your credit card, but there&rsquo;s probably 10-20 computers/routers in between you and the amazon.com servers that will be reading every message you send as it goes to amazon. Can you securely send your credit card?</p>
<p>The following ideas will not work, because the guard/servers will know what to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Hey amazon, look at the first letter of every sentence&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hey amazon, use the following encryption algorithm with this key: abc123&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>With no prior knowledge it&rsquo;s pretty difficult (but not impossible). This is why RSA (and other asymmetric algorithms) are pretty cool.</p>
<p>Instead you rely on the fact that it&rsquo;s hard to factor prime numbers (and some number theory), it&rsquo;s possible.</p>
<h3 id="rsa-algorithm">RSA Algorithm</h3>
<p>(This is a purposely wrong/simplified algorithm, it only carry&rsquo;s the spirit of RSA for simplicity.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If I want to send amazon a message I can take two large prime numbers and multiply them together N = p*q. Using the original p and q I can do some number theory to generate a D, and E, which are two other numbers that have special inverse properties. I then throw away p and q. Since no one can determine what p and q are, my algorithm (specifically my D number) is safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then I send amazon/friend my E number (along with N). E is the public key. Since it&rsquo;s a public key it can be sent/seen by anyone, (including the attackers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon/friend can then take a private message they want to send me and perform the following math:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>$$ ciphertext = message^E mod N $$</p>
<p>And send me the ciphertext.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The only way to decrypt the ciphertext and get back the message is if you have the other number (D).</li>
</ol>
<p>$$ message = ciphertext^D mod N $$</p>
<p>I now have the private message they sent me. They either sent their public key, or if they were smart they would have sent a &ldquo;symmetric private key&rdquo; that we could use with another symmetric cryptographic algorithm such as AES. (RSA is very computationally expensive. Much easier to use AES if you can)</p>
<p>At this point we have sent a secure message and can easily send more secure messages. And the guards can intercept every message, and have no idea what is going on.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-rsa">Breaking RSA</h3>
<p>But, using shor&rsquo;s algorithm you can figure out the factors of N. The D/E numbers are based off the original p and q numbers (N = p*q). Using the D number you can decrypt any message.</p>
<p>So, if the guard/server had a quantum computer that ran shor&rsquo;s algorithm, they could decode all the messages by factoring N and computing the D number.</p>
<h3 id="shors-algorithm">Shor&rsquo;s Algorithm</h3>
<p>Shor&rsquo;s algorithm is pretty nifty too. The quantum computer doesn&rsquo;t just factor the numbers, you have to reframe the problem. That&rsquo;s the genius behind shor&rsquo;s algorithm.</p>
<p>Instead you convert the problem such that it has a cyclic answer. Then you take the Quantum Fourier Transform, do some more math, and the factors pop out.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;math&rdquo; that the quantum algorithm solves is \( a^{x} mod N \), where N is the prime number, a is some random number, and &ldquo;x&rdquo; is the number in super position. We have to find the period of this function. (How long until the function repeats itself).</p>
<p>Normally to find the period you have to check the function over and over until it repeats. Classically this could take a very very very long time, but with a quantum computer we can try all the inputs at once, and then extract the pattern (thanks to QFT).</p>
<p>Once you find the period of the function, you simply take the GCD of two numbers to get the factors:</p>
<p>$$ f1 = GCD(N, a^{period/2} + 1) $$
$$ f2 = GCD(N, a^{period/2} - 1) $$</p>
<p>These equations are based on Euler&rsquo;s Theorem. f1 and f2 are our two factors. (So for 15, 3 and 5).</p>
<h2 id="why-multiplication-is-hard">Why Multiplication Is Hard</h2>
<p>I did not expect this. But it turns out the hard part of this was the multiplication!</p>
<p>Multiplication requires a bunch of intermediate steps, and this quickly explodes the number of qubits you need to do computation. In the classical circuit you can destroy intermediate results and re-use them. But not so much in the quantum computer, every step must be reversable if you want it to be a real quantum gate. Multiplying a 3bit number by 3 bit number quickly went to more than 10 qubits, and then I gave up. (It&rsquo;s probably horribly inefficient, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any simple solutions).</p>
<p>My quantum computer is horribly inefficient overall too, and even at 10qubits it&rsquo;s very very slow. (if I optimized/cached some of the matrix code, I could speed it up to probably 16 qubits). But, it&rsquo;s just disappointing to be thwarted by something so simple. I have a new appreciate for multiplication.</p>
<h2 id="slightly-cheating">Slightly cheating</h2>
<p><img src="/shor.png" alt="shor"></p>
<p>So, instead the shor&rsquo;s algorithm implemented above is just something I copied from 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Programming Quantum Computers Essential Algorithms</a>. It only works for 15 with a co-prime of 2.</p>
<p>One day I&rsquo;d like to revisit this, but I need to take a break.</p>
<h3 id="factor-via-grovers">Factor Via Grovers</h3>
<p>I also thought I would be sneaky and just factor the number&rsquo;s using Grover&rsquo;s algorithm, but again it&rsquo;s taken me longer than I would like to build a non-wasteful circuit that does multiplication.</p>
<p>But it seems reasonable that if there was an efficient multiplication, I could just create a quantum circuit with two registers A and B, and my oracle function would be <i>return A*B == N</i>. Then it would only require PI * Sqrt(N)/4 iterations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall the last few days were frustrating. But progress was made. I&rsquo;m super happy that my little quantum computer can even solve a specific case of shor&rsquo;s, but disappointed I couldn&rsquo;t go further at this time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be taking a quick break from Quantum Computing to learn more of the basics. I just picked up a book on numerical methods, I think I&rsquo;ll have some fun with that.</p>

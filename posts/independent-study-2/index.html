          <p>More thinking out loud about independent study</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been two months since I first discussed about the idea of doing 
<a href="/posts/independent-study/">Independent Study</a>. Since then I finished my semester of school (4.0), and have officially decided to drop out of school and give independent study a chance.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how it will go. It&rsquo;s also very probable it&rsquo;s a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now one week into my &ldquo;self study plan&rdquo;. I can already tell it&rsquo;s not going to be easy, but I still feel it&rsquo;s better than the alternative. I am already learning way more than I was learning in school.</p>
<p>This article covers my final motivations for dropping out, a discussion of how it&rsquo;s going, and a discussion of where it&rsquo;s going.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<h3 id="look-smart-or-be-smart">Look smart or be smart?</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to generalize the decision too far, but for how I learn personally, I think my decision of &ldquo;school study&rdquo; vs &ldquo;self study&rdquo; is between picking &ldquo;looking smart&rdquo; or &ldquo;being smart&rdquo;. (This is highly individualized, I think there are plenty of people who go to school and get the benefit of looking and being smart).</p>
<p>As mentioned in the last blog post, I can&rsquo;t believe I have a degree in electrical engineering. I can&rsquo;t do shit when it comes to electrical engineering.</p>
<p>But I program, and programmed throuought college independently, and I regularly won algorithmic competitions, AI competitions, and recently security challenges. I&rsquo;ve since founded companies, made a decent amount of money doing programming/security, and feel pretty confident.</p>
<p>I want to feel about physics how I feel about programming, not how I feel about Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>Going back to school for a semester was a good reminder of the &ldquo;look smart&rdquo; vs &ldquo;be smart&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t want to name any specific classes, but I got a 4.0, and can pretty confidently say I didn&rsquo;t learn much (not talking about your class, CM, if you&rsquo;re reading).</p>
<h3 id="lectures-are-outdated">Lectures are outdated?</h3>
<p>The lectures usually go too slow to pay attention, I find my self day dreaming. Or frustrated that I could have read the chapter in the book faster and learned the material.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s hard for any professor to compete with the best textbooks in terms of teaching. Really smart people who deeply care about teaching write the textbooks and the best (hopefully) float to the top.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the best lectures are already for free! With M.I.T. and Stanford and others putting lectures online, it&rsquo;s hard to compete.</p>
<h3 id="arbitrary-deadlines">Arbitrary Deadlines</h3>
<p>I believe that you learn from doing problems. But I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;homework&rdquo; is the best way. I personally feel rushed when doing homework and assignments. If I have a bunch of assignments due, I&rsquo;m going to rush through the problems to get the answers. I don&rsquo;t want to stay up all night because of these arbitrary deadlines. A lot of the time that means scanning the book for formulas and plugging and chugging in numbers. As mentioned, I got a 4.0, the system rewards that type of behaviour.</p>
<p>I think most students I know are just getting better at finding formluas that kind of resemble the problem and plug and chug the numbers till something works.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not learning.</p>
<p>When I program, if something comes up, I don&rsquo;t gloss over it in hopes of partial credit. I research the issue, I try to understand it. I don&rsquo;t have a deadline. If something takes me longer than expected, who cares.</p>
<p>I think that behaviour is significantly better for learning, I hate that we have to put learning into timeboxed locks.</p>
<p>I plan on spending the next 30+ years doing and learning physics, I want to understand it and spend my time exploring.</p>
<h3 id="its-expensive">It&rsquo;s expensive</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to argue that school should be any more or less expensive, but it is a fact that 10k a semester is not cheap.</p>
<h3 id="degree">Degree</h3>
<p>Obviously the big reason is the degree. The &ldquo;proof&rdquo; you put in the work.</p>
<p>This is the part, where I will have to figure out ways to compensate.</p>
<p>I think in &ldquo;the real world&rdquo;, there are people in positions of power that don&rsquo;t give a shit about your credentials, they need someone they can trust to solve a problem.</p>
<p>My gamble is that I can learn more than a normal physics student, and then somehow demonstrate that, and still get a job.</p>
<h3 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h3>
<p>Study what you want.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p>The plan isn&rsquo;t too complex, basically it just involves a lot of reading/problems.</p>
<p>Over the last month in my free time I started building a little web app to help organize my learning. Really it&rsquo;s just a work scheduler, but it&rsquo;s also a way for me to track my progress and keep myself motivated. (I&rsquo;m encorporating/playing with some motivational ideas).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely shitty, at the point of being un-usuable for anyone but me: 
<a href="https://selfstudytracker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://selfstudytracker.com</a>, but maybe in a month or so it&rsquo;ll be ready for human consumption.</p>
<p>I wake up at 7:15, spend 15 minutes planning (sometimes cleaning the dishes), then spend 1hr blocks studying or working on projects.</p>
<h2 id="three-days-in">Three days in</h2>
<p>So far I&rsquo;m three days in. It&rsquo;s going decently well. I&rsquo;m studying E&amp;M, Quantum Computing, general relativity, quantum field theory, and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>A number of those subjects I already had experience in, so I&rsquo;m just going through and doing the graduate level problems/books (Sakurri and Jackson for example).</p>
<p>The original goal was to do a chapter a week in each, but I&rsquo;m realizing that will not be possible. So I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;ll be .5 chapters in each a week.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<h3 id="competative">Competative</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that i&rsquo;m very competive. That&rsquo;s one thing that school gives. This 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/42xdz2/question_this_might_sound_childish_but_why_cant/czdth72/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hilarious reddit comment</a> has some truth to it. (Although not that maniacal).</p>

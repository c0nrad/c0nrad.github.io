There is no 100% correct answer.

Intelligence suggest that Couchbase plans to unveil a MongoDB zero-day in less than 24 hours that will destroy the reputation of MongoDB.

Our best secret operative is going on a suicide mission to recover the information. He will mostly likely be captured, strippen of all posessions (USBs/Mini Laptop/Cell phone etc), and will be tortured. He may or may not be able to send a message before being tortured.

He will resist for a while, but we have to assume that he will divulge all information he knows.

You also have to assume that other competitors will be listening on/modifying the wire, and will release the zero-day if they get a hold of it.

It is your task to create a system that:
A.) Simple enough to set up in less than 24 hours
B.) Can't be traced back to MongoDB (can't be proved to have come from MongoDB)
C.) Can be used to transmit the MongoDB zero-day back to HQ.
D.) Can be routed through a completely contested environment (Eve can intercept/modify)
D.) Provide some degree of assurance that if we recieve a message we know it's correct

Bonus Points:
It's possible that once captured, CouchBase will send false data over the wire to trick MongoDB. Is it possible to create a system so we know whether the message is from an unharmed operative, or if Couchbase tortued the protocol out of him?"

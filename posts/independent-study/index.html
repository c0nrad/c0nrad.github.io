          <p>Thinking out loud about my future.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Last year I quit my stable job at MongoDB with two dreams. Start my own company and learn more about the universe. A few months ago my startup hit profitability and I additionally enrolled back at my previous university to get a B.A. in physics. On both fronts, it&rsquo;s been going very well.</p>
<p>But, now that I&rsquo;m 7 weeks back into school, I remember why I left school in the first place (7 years ago).</p>
<p>School seemed like the perfect fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet other people fascinated by physics</li>
<li>Get involved in research projects, open new doors</li>
<li>Get the piece of paper (degree) so I can check the box on future jobs</li>
<li>Spend my time learning in a structured environment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-its-not-working">Why it&rsquo;s not working</h3>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not quite working out that way.</p>
<p>Partially due to COVID, and partially due to the age gap (me turning 29 soon, while other students being significantly younger), finding friends in physics is turning out to be a little more difficult. I&rsquo;m also a bit of a weirdo, and a little bit on the serious side, which makes friendship a little harder. (I find I thrive in a mission-based setting.)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of research out there to do, but a lot of it just seems like research for research’s sake. I specifically want to understand why the universe exists, and those specific projects seem very difficult to get involved in. It&rsquo;s tempting to get involved with a different unrelated project, but there&rsquo;s a significant opportunity cost associated with that. If you&rsquo;re going to spend a year or two on a project, how do you know it&rsquo;s the right project?</p>
<p>And the big reason school isn&rsquo;t working out, personally I find it very hard to learn at school. I have either an A+ or A in all my classes, but I&rsquo;m not learning in school. I learn by doing and exploring and asking questions, and that&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t seem to be how school works. There are two classes I legitimately enjoy (out of the 7 classes and 2 labs I have this semester). But the rest I could do without. And even in those two classes I enjoy (I enjoy them due to the professors), I could move at a much faster pace.</p>
<p>When I reflect on my previous degree (electrical engineering), I sadly know very little about electrical engineering and I went to school for 4.5 years and did decently well in the classes (B+/A- GPA). I could give some examples of how little I know about electrical engineering, but I&rsquo;ll save those for a different day.</p>
<p>Being not humble, I think I know a decent amount about computers/programming/security. And that all happened outside of the classroom. I built 100s if not 1000s of programs. I have 400+ books on computers I&rsquo;ve read (some skimmed) over the last 15 years. Every weekend is a new project, a new exploration, a new idea. That&rsquo;s how I learn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m frustrated that school isn&rsquo;t working out as I had dreamed.</p>
<h3 id="big-picture-i-dont-know-where-im-going">Big Picture, I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going</h3>
<p>As I apply to graduate school, I realize I have no idea what <em>exactly</em> I want to do, and that puts me at the mercy of others. I think it&rsquo;s common for physics students to get involved in a project that a professor they like is working on, next thing you know your name on a paper as an undergrad, and then you&rsquo;re getting your Ph.D. in that subject because you can because you have previous research. Not because you originally wanted to, it just happened that way.</p>
<p>I know I want to learn more about the universe, and I think that will lead me to &ldquo;Beyond Standard Model&rdquo; theories. But what does that even mean? I&rsquo;m reading some books on Quantum Field Theory, but I am in no position to say what exactly I want to study. String theory? Quantum Loop Gravity? Something entirely different? Maybe the answers are in neutrino oscillations? Searching for dark matter? Working at the next collider? It&rsquo;s all luck, but I want it to be my luck.</p>
<p>I know I want to do something spectacular, but I&rsquo;m not in a position to say &ldquo;THIS&rdquo;, &ldquo;THIS&rdquo; is what I want to spend the next 5-7 years of my life studying.</p>
<h2 id="gap-year">Gap Year</h2>
<p>For those two reason, I&rsquo;m thinking of taking a gap year to self-study and play to my strengths. Thankfully my previous software career left me in a position to take a few years off, and I&rsquo;m very good at learning things independently.</p>
<p>I imagine it&rsquo;ll almost be like my own personal &ldquo;masters&rdquo;. I have a specific list of books I plan on doing all/most of the problems from, along with some projects I want to make available to everyone (such as my feynman diagram validator, coming soon) and &ldquo;pretend presentations&rdquo; that I&rsquo;ll put on youtube, similar to presenting to a class.</p>
<p>I plan on spending a decent amount of time on these projects that I&rsquo;ll open source to hopefully demonstrate that I&rsquo;m learning a lot about the subjects. I have some fun ideas that I think will be (1) useful to others (2) very cool to see (3) demonstrate my knowledge of physics. Long term I plan on building tools for the very smart physicists, so having some solid tools in my portfolio will be useful regardless.</p>
<p>I was doing independent study the months leading up to me returning to school. I learned a tremendous amount just spending 8 hours a day reading and doing problems from textbooks. I plan on continuing this pattern.</p>
<p>Oddly independent study is surprisingly stressful. It reminds me of when I first started working on Csper. You become very aware of every &ldquo;wasted hour&rdquo; not spent working. So a non-trivial amount of time will be spent on &ldquo;structure&rdquo;, and making sure I don&rsquo;t get burnt out (nor let my stress leak into others around me).</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also aware you&rsquo;re making a very non-conventional choice, and you feel that pressure of &ldquo;what if this was a terrible idea and I&rsquo;m an idiot and waste a year&rdquo;. That pressure can be very motivating.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m hoping a year from now after reading more QFT/GR/Particle books, (and some books on the fundamentals I&rsquo;m missing, like stat mech, and advance quantum/E&amp;M, advance math), and research papers, I&rsquo;ll know exactly what I want to do, and be in a better position to carve out my own path. And hopefully know more about the universe, which was my original goal!</p>
<p>And if it sucks, I&rsquo;ll get a job as a programmer again. But if it works, I&rsquo;ll come out as a serious problem solving machine.</p>
<p>Anyways, curious about everyone&rsquo;s thoughts. If you think this is a terrible idea, I&rsquo;d love to chat.
